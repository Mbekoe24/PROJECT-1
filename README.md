Title: Poke App: Knowledge Tester
[Poke App Test Website](http://pokeapptest.surge.sh/)

# Project Description:

This project is a Pokémon Knowledge Test App. I will be using an image of different Pokemon from api data to display on the screen. To help with conceptualize this idea, I will be using methods like math.random()/ math.floor() and other methods to help display the randomized pokemon that will display on the screen. The user will than have 10 answer questions to identify the pokemon displayed on the screen. The user must get at least 8 answers correct, to be crowned the newest Pokemon Master.

# API:

I will be using the Pokémon Api (https://pokeapi.co/)

# MVP:

For MVP, I will have all my data recieved from API implemented into my code.
As, well as all my js logic configured and finished for my game. All of my media queries will be set/ layouts for Desktop, iPhone X, iPad, and iPad Pro fully set. My last goal is to have my website live up on surge for users to see/ interactive with.

# Post-MVP:

My plan is to have event listeners built-in for all buttons on page.
Another thing I will like to include is linear gradient backgrounds; as well as including flex or grid to align my images.
I will also have a UX student examine/ critique my app, to see how I can improve the users experience.
There will also be references for all the sources I used, specifically for my images.
I will find a local storage where I can save data.
In additon, having a favicon in place would bring a more organic website feel so I will try to implent that. Lastly, my goal is to incoperate local
